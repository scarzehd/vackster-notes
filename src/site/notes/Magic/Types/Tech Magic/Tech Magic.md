Tech Magic, formerly Alchemy Magic, is a magic type that allows the user to deconstruct objects and fuse them together to form new items. It is often supplemented with [[Telekinesis\|Telekinesis]] to allow for moving parts that are inconvenient or impossible to access with bare hands. The most notable user of Tech Magic is [[Characters/Kenny Ice\|Kenny Ice]].

A common misconception of Tech Magic is that it takes the skill out of engineering. This misconception likely arose from the ease with which the aforementioned Tech Mage [[Characters/Kenny Ice\|Kenny Ice]] constructs new contraptions on the fly. This, however, has less to do with Tech Magic itself than it does with Ice's unmatched intelligence.
