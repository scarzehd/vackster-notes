# Bio
Ezra Flamestriker was once the most powerful character in 27-27. He existed at the Power Cap before the [[Great Power Expansion\|Great Power Expansion]]. He was originally one of the favored characters of his [[Creator\|Creator]], [[S. C. Arzehd\|S. C. Arzehd]], granting him the status of a [[Main Character\|Main Character]]. After the Great Power Expansion, Ezra was unable to keep up with the power levels of his newly-uncapped peers. Since then, he has fallen out of favor with his Creator.

Ezra is known for his masterful use of [[Magic/Types/Fire Magic/Fire Magic\|Fire Magic]]. He is especially fond of the [[Magic/Types/Fire Magic/Motifs/Flash Fire\|Flash Fire]] [[Magic/Magic Motif\|Motif]].

More recent character developments have left EF, who now despises his Creator and the name she bestowed on him, in a deep depression.
